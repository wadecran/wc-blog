						<h2 class="mb-4">Hello! I'm Wade Cranford</h2>
						<p>I've always been interested in technology. At a young age science fiction has peeked my interests, and I had begun reading the works of Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov. 
						I continued to nurture this interest, and in high-school joined out robotics team that competed in the FIRST competition. This was my first step into programming with C++.
						We did what we could programming speed controllers to influence the motors, and even managed to get the robot to perform some autonomous tasks. If I'm honest, we didn't fully understand
						what was going on, and received an abundance of help from our instructors. Even though I didn't grasp everything, I knew programming was something special.</p>
						<p>After sometime I found myself doing mainly retail and blue collar work. My interest in technology continued to grow (how couldn't it in the times we live in), and my love for programming
						was always around. I began taking courses on Udemy to tray and find a way to "break in" to the a career that always seemed so close, but with a steep learning cure, so far away.
						After building tic-tac-toe enough time's I should publish a book and enough to-do lists to plan out the next ten years, I found Coder Foundry. This blog, initially, will serve as a journal for 
						my experiences with the boot camp.</p>
